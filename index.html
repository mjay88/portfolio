            <h3>No time like the present to consider a career change.</h3>
            <p>I've always wanted to be able work remotely, and with how the coronavirus has affected the economy across all industies, I figure right about now might be a good time to make a transition into the another industry.</p>
            <p>During my journey to learn Front End Development, I will be using this website as a personal reference/notes for topics I have covered, ultimately culminating into a portfolio of skill sets I have learned and concepts I have mastered. Some
                of the information will be redundant, and some of it incorrect at first, while I navigate the internet of things in an attempt to decifer this <em>language</em> that is new to me. So please, bare with us...
