            <h3>Introduction to CSS</h3>
            <p>On this page, the plan right now is to demonstrate the styling of HTML elements. I will randomly be picking HTML elements and showing various ways we can modify there apperance in the browser through CSS. But first, what the heck is CSS?
            </p>
            <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a markup language used to dictate how websites appear visually. How far away things are from each other, the thickness of a border, the shadow of some header text, background colors, the font
                type; are all controlled with CSS. CSS is pretty straight forward from what I understand, the hardest part being appreciating the size and scope of what is possible with CSS, the type of appreciation that I know will only come with months
                and months of practice.
            </p>
            <p>CSS can be applied three ways. We can include CSS directly inline on each element, but this is typically not considered best practice. CSS can be included in the head tag of an HTML document inside of a style tag as well. This method is not
                considered good practice either. Using these methods will drastically limit the true potential of what CSS can do, and your mark-up will be redundant and unnecesarily verbose. The best excepted practice is the external stylesheet way.
                This method, you create a completely different type of file, a .css file, and link it to your html files through specfications in the html files head tag.

            <p>You should notice relatively quickly that almost everything you do with CSS will follow a simple basic pattern...

            <h3>Now lets style some stuff</h3>
            <h4>Buttons</h4>
            <p>The button element is pretty straight forward...click it to do something! Im sure I will learn how to send the button clicks to the right place, but for the purposes of this CSS page we will be using this element and all the following elements
                only to demonstrate styling.
            </p>
            <button id="button-1">I am a button!</button>
            <button id="button-2">I am a button!</button>
            <button id="button-3">I am a button!</button>
            <button id="button-4">I am a button!</button>
            <p>With CSS we can make our button a lot more appealing than the default HTML button element appears without any styling.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h4>Forms</h4>
            <p>Forms can be used for all sorts things from collecting user input to navigating a user through the process of making a purchase on a website to so much more...</p>
            <form action="send-to">

            <h4>Tables</h4>
            <p>Table elements are also an essential part of HTML. They are used to format a wide range of features on any given website. I already included a table on this page and here is a hyperlink that will jump to that table so you can check out the
                sweet styling we can do with CSS. Jump to <a id="table" href="#table">"Break it down"</a>
