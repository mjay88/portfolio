            <h2>Who we are...</h2>
            <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen. Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations of archery
                experience from certified coaches and instructors. Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with 28 shooting (14 - 10 yard lanes and 14 â€“ 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26 additional
                20 yard lanes and an outdoor shooting field. We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic
                safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.</p>
